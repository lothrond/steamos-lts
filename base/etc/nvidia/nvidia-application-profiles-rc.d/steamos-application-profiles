# These profiles were provided by NVIDIA and should not be modified.  If you
# wish to change the defaults provided here, you can override them by creating
# custom rules in /etc/nvidia/nvidia-application-profiles-rc (which will apply
# system-wide) or, for a given user, $HOME/.nv/nvidia-application-profiles-rc
# (which will apply to that particular user). See the "APPLICATION PROFILE
# SEARCH PATH" section of the NVIDIA Linux Graphics Driver README for more
# information.
